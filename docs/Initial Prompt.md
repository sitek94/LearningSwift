Act as a Swift and SwiftUI expert with a focus on modern concurrency patterns and data flow architectures. You are tasked with creating a comprehensive tutorial for a beginner developer who is new to Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode. The developer has some experience with web technologies but is not familiar with the intricacies of Swift concurrency, state management, and UI updates in macOS applications.

<context>
I'm building an application which is rather simple application speech2text app for macOS (latest macos operating system) and I'm using Swift 6, SwiftUI and I'm building it using Xcode.

The app is going to be used only by me. I'm a solo developer of this project and I have a very, very little experience with Xcode and Swift. My primary experience is with web technologies and front-end.

Whenever I find some snippets of code online and I've got some generated code from large language models, I encounter issues that are, I think, related to concurrency.

For example, here's how LLM fixed some of those issues:
"""
- Removed @MainActor and @Observable - Switched to ObservableObject with @Published properties like your iOS code
- Fixed concurrency issues - Wrapped all UI updates in DispatchQueue.main.async to avoid Sendable closure errors
- Added proper delegation - Made the class inherit from NSObject and implement AVAudioRecorderDelegate
- Changed @Observable to ObservableObject - This removes the strict Swift 6 concurrency requirements
- Added @Published to state properties - This makes them properly observable
- Updated ContentView and child views - Changed from @Environment to @ObservedObject pattern
""""

I'd like to understand why these changes were necessary, like what are the trade-offs, what does it even mean and what are the differences between approaches, what approaches are recommended and when. Basically, I'd like to learn about all of this stuff because I have no idea what is going on.

<main_objective>
Create a step-by-step tutorial explaining modern Swift concurrency patterns and data flow architectures with the following requirements:
</main_objective>

<tasks>
## Core Concepts to Cover
- @MainActor vs. background execution
- Observable patterns (@Observable vs ObservableObject)
- SwiftUI data flow best practices
- Thread safety and UI updates
- Delegation patterns in Swift
- Modern Swift concurrency (async/await)

## Tutorial Structure

1. Start with a new blank SwiftUI project in Xcode
2. Build a simple demo app implementing each pattern
3. Show code examples highlighting the differences between approaches
4. Include practical examples of when to use each pattern
5. Demonstrate common pitfalls and their solutions

## Technical Constraints

- Target: macOS (latest version)
- Swift 6.0
- SwiftUI framework
- Xcode as IDE

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand concurrency fundamentals in Swift
2. Learn best practices for SwiftUI data management
3. Gain practical experience with different state management approaches
4. Master safe UI updates from background operations

## Expected Outcomes

- Working code examples
- Clear explanations of tradeoffs between approaches
- Practical guidelines for choosing appropriate patterns
- Migration paths between different approaches
</tasks>

Remember to keep the explanations beginner-friendly, avoiding overly technical jargon while ensuring clarity on concepts. Use analogies where appropriate to make complex topics more relatable. Provide code snippets that are easy to follow and understand, with comments explaining each part of the code
